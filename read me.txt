Text Autocomplete Feature

Overview

The Text Autocomplete Feature is a simple and efficient implementation of a dynamic suggestion system that provides users with real-time recommendations as they type into an input field. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be integrated seamlessly into various web applications, such as search bars, forms, and e-commerce sites.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with a professional and modern UI.

Accessibility: Includes intuitive focus effects and supports user-friendly navigation.

Outside Click Dismissal: The suggestion list automatically hides when the user clicks outside the input field.

1) index.html: Contains the HTML structure.


2) autocomplete.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for the autocomplete functionality.

3)textcss.css : containing the styling.

How It Works

* Dataset Filtering: A predefined dataset of strings is used to suggest matches. The input value is compared against the dataset to filter and display relevant suggestions.

* User Interaction: As users type, the dropdown dynamically updates with matching options. Clicking an option autofills the input field.

* Dismissal Logic: Clicking outside the dropdown or clearing the input automatically hides the suggestions.
